INTRODUCTION</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="INTRO_I" id="INTRO_I"></a>
I. ON TITIAN&rsquo;S CHARACTER AS AN ARTIST.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no greater name in Italian art&mdash;therefore
no greater in art&mdash;than that of Titian.&rdquo; These words of
the distinguished art critic, Claude Phillips, express the
verdict of more than three centuries. It is agreed that
no other painter ever united in himself so many qualities
of artistic merit. Other painters may have equalled him
in particular respects, but &ldquo;rounded completeness,&rdquo; quoting
another critic&rsquo;s phrase, is &ldquo;what stamps Titian as a
master.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>To begin with the qualities which are apparent even in
black and white reproduction, we are impressed at once with
the vitality which informs all his figures. They are breathing
human beings, of real flesh and blood, pulsing with
life. They represent all classes and conditions, from such
royal sitters as Charles V. and Philip II. to the peasants
and boatmen who served as models for St. Christopher, St.
John, and the Pharisee of the Tribute Money. They portray,
too, every age: the tender infancy of the Christ child,
the girlhood of the Virgin, the dawning manhood of the
Man with the Glove, the maidenhood of Medea, the young
motherhood of Mary, the virile middle life of Venetian
Senators, the noble old age of St. Jerome and St. Peter,
each is set vividly before us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
The list contains no mystics and ascetics: life, and life
abundant, is the keynote of Titian&rsquo;s art. The abnormal
finds no place in it. Health and happiness are to him
interchangeable terms.</p>

<p>Yet it must not be supposed that Titian&rsquo;s delineation
of life stopped short with the physical: he was besides a
remarkable interpreter of the inner life. Though not as
profound a psychologist as Leonardo or Lotto, he had at
all times a just appreciation of character, and, on occasion,
rose to a supreme touch in its interpretation. In such
studies as the Flora, where he is interested chiefly in working
out certain technical problems, he takes small pains
to make anything more of his subject than a beautiful
animal. The Man with the Glove stands at the other end
of the scale. Here we have a personality so individual,
and so possessing, as it were, that the portrait takes rank
among the world&rsquo;s masterpieces of psychic interpretation.</p>

<p>In his best works Titian&rsquo;s sense of the dramatic holds
the golden mean between conventionality and sensationalism.
In the group of sacred personages surrounding the
Madonna and Child there is sufficient action to constitute
a reason for their presence,&mdash;to relieve the figures of that
artificial and purely spectacular character which they have
in the earlier art,&mdash;yet the action is restrained and dignified
as befits the occasion. The pose of both figures in
the Christ of the Tribute Money is in the highest degree
dramatic without being in any way theatrical. The tempered
dignity of Titian&rsquo;s dramatic power is also admirably
seen in the Assumption of the Virgin. The apostles'
action is full of passion, yet without violence; the buoyant
motion of the Virgin is unmarred by any exaggeration.</p>

<p>The same painting illustrates Titian&rsquo;s magnificent mastery
of composition. Perhaps the Pesaro Madonna alone
of all his other works is worthy to be classed with it
in this respect. It is impossible to conceive of anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
better in composition than these two works. Not a line in
either could be altered without detriment to the organic
unity of the plan.</p>

<p>The crowning excellence of Titian is his color. The
chief of the school in which color was the characteristic
quality, he represents all the best elements in its color
work. If others excelled him in single efforts or in some
one respect, none equalled him for sustained grandeur.
A recent criticism sums up his color qualities succinctly in
these words: &ldquo;He had at once enough of golden strength,
enough of depth, enough of éclat; his color, profound and
powerful <i>per se</i>, impresses us more than that of the others,
because he brought more of other qualities to enforce it.&rdquo;
<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Titian&rsquo;s works easily fall into a few groups, according
to the subject treated. In mythological themes he was in
his natural element. Here he could express the sheer joy
of living which was common to the Venetian and the
Greek. Here physical beauty was its own excuse for
being, without recourse to any ulterior significance. Here
he could exercise unhindered his marvellous skill in modelling
the human form along those perfect lines of grace
which give Greek sculpture its distinctive character. It
is in his earlier period that his affinity with the Greek
spirit is closest, and we see it in perfect fruition in the
Medea and Venus.</p>

<p>Titian&rsquo;s treatment of sacred subjects is in the diverse
moods of his many-sided artistic nature. The great ceremonial
altar pieces, such as the Assumption of the Virgin,
and the Pesaro Madonna, are a perfect reflection of the
religious spirit of his environment. Religion was with
the Venetians a delightful pastime, an occasion for festivals
and pageants, a means of increasing the civic glory.
These great decorative pictures are full of the pomp and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
magnificence dear to Venice, full of the joy and pride of
life.</p>

<p>Yet in another mood Titian paints the life of the Holy
Family as a pastoral idyl. A sunny landscape, a happy
young mother, a laughing baby boy, bring the sacred subject
very near to common human sympathies.</p>

<p>Some of Titian&rsquo;s professedly sacred pictures are in the
vein of pure <i>genre</i>, painted in a period when this department
of art had not yet attained independent existence.
We see such works in the St. Christopher and the St. John.
These direct studies of the people throw an interesting
light upon the painter of ideal beauty: they show an otherwise
unsuspected vigor.</p>

<p>The Christ of the Tribute Money stands alone in Titian&rsquo;s
sacred art. The technical qualities are thoroughly characteristic
of his hand, but a new note is struck in spiritual
feeling. Virile, without coarseness; gentle, without weakness,
the chief figure is perhaps the most intellectual ideal
of Christ which has been conceived in art.</p>

<p>Titian&rsquo;s landscapes, though holding an accessory place
only in his art, are counted by the critical art historian
with those of Giorgione, as the practical beginning of this
branch of art. He knew how to express &ldquo;the quintessence
of nature&rsquo;s most significant beauties without a too
slavish adherence to any special set of natural facts.&rdquo;
<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
His imagination interpreted many of nature&rsquo;s moods, from
the pastoral calm environing Medea and Venus to the
stormy grandeur of the forest in which St. Peter Martyr
met his fate.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly as a portrait-painter that Titian&rsquo;s many
great qualities meet in their utmost perfection. His feeling
for textures, the delicacy with which he painted the
hair and the hands; his skill in modelling; his instinct for
pose; the infinite variety of his resources, made an incomparable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
equipment in the secondary matters of portrait
painting. To these he added, as we have seen, the two
highest essentials of the art, the power of giving life to
his sitter, and the gift of insight into character.</p>

<p>Nature made him a court painter; he loved to impart
to his sitter that air of noble distinction whose secret he
so well understood. Yet he was too large a man to let
this or any other natural preference hamper him. Something
of himself, it is true, he frequently put into his figures,
yet he was at times capable of thoroughly objective
work. He stands perhaps somewhere between the extreme
subjectivity of Van Dyck and the splendid realism of
Velasquez. The noble company of his sitters, emperors,
kings, doges, popes, cardinals and bishops, noblemen,
poets and beautiful women, still make their presence felt
in the world. Theirs was a deathless fame on whom the
painter conferred the gift of his art.</p>

<p>Titian&rsquo;s temperament was keenly sensitive to the influences
of his environment, and in his extraordinary length
of days, Venice passed through various changes, political,
social, artistic and religious, which left their mark upon
his work. One cannot make a random selection from his
pictures and pronounce upon the qualities of his art. The
work of his youth, his maturity, his old age, has each a
character of its own. It is this rounding out of his art
life through successive stages of growth and even of decay
that gives the entire body of his works the character of
a living organism.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a name="INTRO_II" id="INTRO_II"></a>
II. ON BOOKS OF REFERENCE.</p>

<p>The original source of biographical material relating to
Titian is in Vasari&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lives of the Painters,&rdquo; the best
edition of which is the Foster translation, annotated with
critical and explanatory comments by E. H. and E. W.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
Blashfield and A. A. Hopkins. The most complete modern
biography is that by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, in two
large volumes (published in 1877), but as this is now
out of print, it can be consulted only in the large libraries.
Some of the conclusions of these writers have been challenged
by later critics, Morelli and others, and should not
be accepted without weighing the new arguments. The
volume on &ldquo;Titian: A Study of his Life and Work,&rdquo;
by Claude Phillips, Keeper of the Wallace Collection,
London, is in line with the modern methods of criticism,
and is written in a delightful vein of appreciation. The
two parts of the book, The Earlier Work and The Later
Work, correspond to the two monographs for &ldquo;The Portfolio,&rdquo;
in which the work was first published.</p>

<p>In the general histories of Italian art, valuable chapters
on Titian are contained in Kugler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Handbook of the
Italian Schools&rdquo; (to be read in the latest edition by A. H.
Layard) and Mrs. Jameson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Early Italian Painters&rdquo;
(to be read in the latest revision by Estelle M. Hurll).
A monograph on Titian is issued in the German Series of
Art Monographs, edited by H. Knackfuss.</p>

<p>Interesting suggestions upon the study of Titian&rsquo;s art
will be found in the following references: In Mrs.
Oliphant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Makers of Venice;&rdquo; in Berenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Venetian
Painters of the Renaissance;&rdquo; in Symonds&rsquo;s volume
on Fine Arts in the series &ldquo;Renaissance in Italy.&rdquo;
Burckhardt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cicerone&rdquo; has some valuable pages on
Titian, but the book is out of print. A List of Titian&rsquo;s
work is given in Berenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Venetian Painters.&rdquo;</p>

III. HISTORICAL DIRECTORY OF THE PICTURES OF
THIS COLLECTION.</p>

<p><i>Portrait frontispiece.</i> Probably the portrait mentioned
by Vasari as painted in 1502. In the Prado Gallery,
Madrid. Size: 2 ft. 10 in. by 2 ft. 1&frac12; in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
1. <a href="#fig1"><i>The Physician Parma.</i></a> It appears that there is no
direct testimony to prove the authorship of this picture,
the attribution to Titian having been made by an early
director of the gallery, following certain evidence from
Rudolfi. Herr Wickhoff claims the picture for Domenico
Campagnola, and the recent biographer of Giorgione
(Herbert Cook) includes it among the works of that
painter. The attribution to Titian is, however, not disputed
by the two severest of modern critics, Morelli and

THE PHYSICIAN PARMA</p>

<p>We are about to study a few pictures reproduced
from the works of a great Venetian painter of the
sixteenth century,&mdash;Titian. The span of this man&rsquo;s
life covered nearly a hundred years, from 1477 to
1576, a period when Venice was a rich and powerful
city. The Venetians were a pleasure-loving people,
fond of pomp and display. They delighted in sumptuous
entertainments, and were particularly given to
pageants. We read of the picturesque processions
that paraded the square of St. Mark&rsquo;s, or floated in
gondolas along the grand canal. The city was full
of fine buildings, palaces, churches, and public halls.
Their richly ornamented fronts of colored marbles,
bordering the blue water of the canals, made a brilliant
panorama of color. The buildings were no less
beautiful within than without, being filled with the
splendid paintings of the Venetian masters.</p>

<p>The pictures in the churches and monasteries
illustrated sacred story and the fives of the saints;
those in the public halls depicted historical and
allegorical themes, while the private palaces were
adorned with mythological scenes and portraits.</p>

<p>Titian engaged in works of all these kinds, and
seemed equally skilful in each. The great number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and variety of his pictures bring vividly before us
the manners and customs of his times. His art is
like a great mirror in which Venice of the sixteenth
century is clearly reflected in all her magnificence.
As we study our little prints, we must bear in mind
that the original paintings glow with rich and
harmonious color. As far as possible let us try to
supply this lost color from our imagination.</p>

<p>Nearly all the notable personages of the time sat
to Titian for their portraits,&mdash;emperors, queens, and
princes, popes, and cardinals, the doges, or dukes,
of Venice, noblemen, poets, and fair women. Wearing
the costumes of a bygone age, these men and
women look out of their canvases as if they were
still living, breathing human beings. The painter
endowed them with the magic gift of immortality.
Though the names of many of the sitters are now
forgotten, and we know little or nothing of their
lives, they are still real persons to us, with their life
history written on their faces.</p>

<p>Such is the man called Parma, who is believed to
have been a physician of Titian&rsquo;s time, but whose
only biography is this portrait. If we were told that
it was the portrait of some eminent physician now
practising in New York or London, we should perhaps
be equally ready to believe it. We might meet
such a figure in our streets to-morrow. There is
nothing in the costume to mark it as peculiar to any
century or country. The black gown is such as is
still worn by clergymen and university men. The
man would not have to be pointed out to us as a
celebrity; we should know him at once as a person
of distinction.</p>

<p>The science of medicine was making great progress
during the sixteenth century. It was then
that the subject of anatomy was first developed by
the celebrated Fleming, Vesalius, court physician to
Charles V.<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In this
period, also, the science of chemistry
first came to be separated from alchemy, and
progressive physicians applied the new learning to
their practice.</p>

<p>We may be sure that our Doctor Parma belonged
to the most enlightened class of his profession. His
strong: intellectual face shows him to be one who
would have little patience with quackery or superstition.
He has a high, noble forehead, keen, penetrating
eyes, and a firm mouth. His beautiful white
hair gives him a venerable aspect, though he is not
of great age. It blows about his face as fine and
light as gossamer. He is an ideal &ldquo;family physician,&rdquo;
of a generation ago. We can imagine how
children would learn to look upon him with love
and respect, perhaps also with a little wholesome
fear.</p>

<p>The hand which holds the folds of the long,
black gown has a character of its own as definite as
that of the face. It is a strong, firm hand, which
looks capable of guiding skilfully a surgeon&rsquo;s knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Two fine seal rings ornament it. Such rings, sometimes
of curious design and workmanship, were
often bestowed as gifts by wealthy noblemen upon
those who had done them some service.</p>

<p>The doctor Parma looks as good as he is wise.
This benign face would grace an assembly of notable
clergymen. Indeed, the picture suggests a well-known
portrait of the great John Wesley, whose
features were cast in the same strong mould, and
who also had an abundance of bushy white hair.</p>

<p>By another play of the fancy we could imagine
this a portrait of some eminent judge. There is
that in the face which indicates the calm, impartial,
deliberate mind that belongs to the character. He
might now be about to charge the jury, or perhaps
even to pronounce sentence.</p>

<p>Still another opinion is that here we have a Venetian
senator in his official robes. The man is in any
case an ideal professional man, a person of brains
and character, who could fill equally well a position
of responsibility in medicine, law, administrative
affairs, or divinity. With a strict sense of justice, a
stern contempt for anything mean and base, and a
fatherly tenderness for the weak and oppressed, he
is one in whom we could safely put confidence.</p>

THE PRESENTATION OF THE VIRGIN</p>

<p class="caption3">(<i>Detail</i>)</p>

<p>In the town of Nazareth many centuries ago lived
a pious old couple, named Joachim and Anna. It
is said that they &ldquo;divided all their substance in three
parts: &rdquo; one part &ldquo;for the temple,&rdquo; another for &ldquo;the
poor and pilgrims,&rdquo; and the third for themselves.
The delight of their old age was their only child
Mary, who afterwards became the mother of Jesus.
She had been born, as they believed, in answer to
their prayers, and they cherished her with peculiar
devotion.</p>

<p>That Mary was a good and lovable child beyond
common measure we can have no doubt: she was
set apart for a strange and holy service. The beautiful
story of her early life is told in an old Latin
book called the &ldquo;Legenda Aurea,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Golden
Legend.&rdquo; This was a collection of old legends written
out for the first time by Jacopo de Voragine, an
Italian archbishop of the thirteenth century. The
early English translation by Caxton, in which we still
read the book, preserves the quaint flavor of the
original. There is one portion of it describing
the dedication, or presentation, of the Virgin in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
temple. Before Mary was born, the mother, Anna, had
promised the angel of the Lord that she would present
the coming child as an offering to the Lord.
Long before her day, a certain Hannah had made a
like vow under similar circumstances. Her son Samuel,
a &ldquo;child obtained by petition,&rdquo; was &ldquo;returned,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;lent,&rdquo; to the Lord as long as he lived.<a
name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A child
thus dedicated was early carried to the temple to be
educated within its precincts for special service to
God.</p>

<p>The presentation of Mary was on this wise:
&ldquo;And then when she had accomplished the time of
three years &#8230; they brought her to the temple with
offerings. And there was about the temple, after
the fifteen psalms of degrees, fifteen steps or grees
to ascend up to the temple, because the temple was
high set. And nobody might go to the altar of
sacrifices that was without, but by the degrees. And
then our Lady was set on the lowest step; and
mounted up without any help as she had been of
perfect age, and when they had performed their
offering, they left their daughter in the temple with
the other virgins, and they returned into their place.
And the Virgin Mary profited every day in all holiness,
and was visited daily by angels, and had every
day divine visions.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_7" id="FNanchor_2_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> We see at once the picture
there is in the story, the little girl ascending alone
the long flight of steps, with the fond parents gazing
after her in wonder. Many artists have put the
subject on canvas, and among them our Venetian
painter Titian. His is an immense picture, from
which the central figure only is reproduced in our
illustration.</p>

<p>We must imagine ourselves standing with a great
throng of people in the public square in front of the
temple. Men, women and children jostle one another
near the steps. The old man Joachim and his
wife Anna are easily singled out among the number.
The windows of the adjoining palaces are full of
faces looking into the square. A group of senators
stand somewhat apart, looking on. An old peasant
woman with a basket of eggs sits in the shadow of
the steps. All eyes are turned towards the little
child who is walking alone up the great stone staircase.
On the topmost step the high priest advances
to meet her, resplendent in his rich priestly garments.</p>

<p>The figure of the little Virgin is very quaint in a
long gown made of some shimmering blue stuff.
The golden hair is brushed back primly and woven
into a heavy braid, whence it at last escapes in
beautiful profusion. It would be hard to guess the
child&rsquo;s age, for her demeanor is that of a little woman
as she gathers her long skirt daintily in her
right hand. She carries herself erect in the new
dignity of the great moment, and advances with
perfect self-confidence. The face, however, is quite
childlike and innocent, and is lifted to the priest&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
with a happy smile. The left arm is raised in a gesture
of wonder and delight.</p>

<p>The whole figure is surrounded by a halo of
golden light. This is the oval-shaped glory which
the Italians call the <i>mandorla</i>, from the word meaning
&ldquo;almond.&rdquo; It is of course the symbol of the
virgin&rsquo;s peculiar sanctity. The painter has not tried
to make the little girl particularly pretty, but he
gives her the indescribable charm which we call winsomeness.
She is perhaps one of the most lovable
children art has ever produced.</p>

<p>As we study the artist&rsquo;s method of work in the
picture we see how very simply the figure is drawn.
Titian was fond of rich and voluminous draperies,
as we shall learn from several examples which are to
follow. Here, however, he draws a dress with tight
sleeves and scanty skirt absolutely without decoration
of any sort. It is this simplicity which gives
the childlike appearance to the figure.</p>

<p>There is a pathos in the little figure which we cannot
altogether appreciate in our illustration. We
have to remember that the whole picture measures
twenty-five feet in width by eleven in height, and
then imagine how tiny the child looks ascending
alone the great staircase in the centre of this vast
panorama. The isolation of the figure suggests the
singular destiny of Mary, set apart from others in
the loneliness of a unique service.</p>

THE EMPRESS ISABELLA</p>

<p>The most illustrious of Titian&rsquo;s many patrons was
the Emperor Charles V., whose wife was the Empress
Isabella of our portrait. This powerful monarch had
inherited from one grandfather, Ferdinand, the
kingdom of Spain, and from another, Maximilian,
the empire of Germany. His marriage was arranged
chiefly for political reasons, but proved to be a happy
one.</p>

<p>Isabella was the daughter of Emmanuel the Great,
late King of Portugal, and the sister of John III.,
the reigning king. She was a princess of uncommon
beauty and accomplishments. The Portuguese government
bestowed a superb dowry of nine hundred
thousand crowns upon her, and the marriage was
celebrated in Seville in 1526. The ceremony was
splendid, and there were great festivities following.</p>

<p>Soon after, the emperor travelled with his bride
through Andalusia and Granada that he might see
his new kingdom. Called at last to other parts of
his dominion, he left Isabella as regent in Spain, and
went to Italy, where in 1532 he first called Titian
into service to paint his portrait. In the years that
followed the painter found the emperor a constant
and generous patron, and was frequently summoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to meet the court at various places. In the meantime,
however, the lovely empress never had had a
sitting to the first painter of the day. She stayed
quietly at home and had her portrait painted by
such inferior artists as were at hand.</p>

<p>When she died in 1539 Charles was left disconsolate,
without any satisfactory portrait of her beloved
face. He accordingly sent to Titian a portrait of
her painted at the age of twenty-four, and required
him to use it as the basis of a picture. The painter
obeyed, and soon sent, his royal patron two canvases,
begging him to return them with criticisms if
he wished any changes made. As they were never
sent back we infer that Charles found them as much
like the original as could have been expected. The
fame of Isabella&rsquo;s beauty and goodness had of course
come to the painter&rsquo;s knowledge, and this was perhaps
a better inspiration than the old portrait which
was his guide. Certainly the picture he produced
shows a winning personality.</p>

<p>The empress is seated near a window, holding a
little book open in one hand, probably a prayer-book
or Book of Hours. The lady is not reading, but
gazes somewhat pensively before her, as if thinking
over the familiar words. The face is gentle and refined,
and has an innocent purity of expression like
that of a child.</p>

<p>The features are small, and modelled with an almost
doll-like regularity. Yet the mouth is set firmly
enough to indicate a strong will behind it. Isabella
was indeed a woman of remarkable self-control. A
story is told that once when ill and in great pain
she turned her face in the shadow that none might
see her suffer, and uttered no sound of complaining.
Her nurses remonstrated, but she replied firmly,
&ldquo;Die I may, but wail I will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The costume of a Spanish queen of the sixteenth
century naturally interests us. Apparently Spanish
Court etiquette of the period dictated a dress made
with high neck and long sleeves. The bodice is of
red velvet, the loose sleeves lined with satin. The
under bodice, which we should call a <i>guimpe</i>, is of
white muslin with gold fillets. A jewel adorns the
red hair, and a long necklace of pearls is caught on
the bosom with a pendant of rubies and emeralds.
The careful dressing of the hair, the strict propriety
of the gown, and the attitude of the queen herself
suggest the regard of conventionality which governed
the great lady.</p>

<p>What the portrait lacks is the quality of lifelikeness
which makes other pictures by Titian so wonderful.
<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Naturally the painter could not so easily
impart vitality to the picture when not working
directly from the living model. To make up, as it
were, for this defect, he painted the various textures
of the dress with marvellous skill. Satin, velvet, and
muslin, each is distinguished by its own peculiar
lustre.</p>

<p>The bit of landscape seen through the window is
another beautiful part of the picture. The distance
gives depth to the composition and avoids the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
crowded effect it might otherwise have. We shall
see a similar setting again in the portrait of <a href="#fig7">Lavinia</a>.</p>

<p>The Emperor had been very fond of his wife, and
an old historian says that &ldquo;he treated her on all
occasions with much distinction and regard.&rdquo; If
this seems nothing surprising to note, we must
remember that at the same period Henry VIII. of
England was treating his queens quite differently.</p>

<p>In the last years of his life Charles V., weary of
the cares of government, relinquished his kingdom
to his son. He retired to the convent of Yuste to
end his days, taking with him this portrait of his
wife. When he lay on his death-bed he asked to
see the picture, and when at last he died his body
was laid to rest beside Isabella. Their son, Philip II.,
whose portrait we are presently to study, succeeded
to a portion of his father&rsquo;s dominion.</p>

MADONNA AND CHILD WITH SAINTS</p>

<p>There was never a child so longed for as the
Child Jesus, and none whose infancy has been held
in such loving remembrance. Centuries before his
birth the prophets of Israel preached to the people
of his coming. Year after year men waited eagerly
for One who would teach them the way of righteousness.
On the night when he was born the angels
of heaven appeared in the sky with the glad tidings.
His birthday ushered in a new era.</p>

<p>We all know the story of his infancy in the Bethlehem
manger, of his boyhood in the little town of
Nazareth, of the years of his ministry throughout
Judea, and of his crucifixion on Calvary. The
narrative of his life was written by the four evangelists,
and has been told in nearly every part of the
world.</p>

<p>Many of the great painters have drawn the subjects
of their best pictures from the story in the
Gospels. A favorite subject has been the mother
Mary holding the Babe in her arms, as in our illustration.
To understand why the other figures are
included in the scene, a few words of explanation
are necessary.</p>

<p>In the early days of Christianity the followers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the new faith had to endure great persecutions, and
many laid down their lives for their Master. The
religious liberty we enjoy to-day is due to the courage
and loyalty of these early saints and martyrs.
Much, too, is due to the work of those teachers who
are called the Fathers of the church. These saints
and heroes of the olden time have been honored in
art and song and story. It is fitting to associate
their memory with that of him to whom they gave
their lives. This is the reason why in pictures of
the Mother and Child Jesus we often see them
standing by.</p>

<p>Such pictures do not represent any actual historical
event. The various persons represented may not
even be contemporaries. It is in a devotional and
not a literal sense that they worship the Christ
child together.</p>

<p>In our picture the Mother tends her Babe at one
side while three saints form an attendant company.
The nearest is St. Stephen, the young man &ldquo;full of
faith and power,&rdquo; who did &ldquo;great wonders and miracles
among the people&rdquo; of Jerusalem in the apostolic
days. When false witnesses accused him of blasphemy
his face was like &ldquo;the face of an angel.&rdquo;
Nevertheless, when his accusers heard his defence
they were angry at his frank denunciations, and
casting him out of the city, stoned him to death.

<p>The old man standing next is St. Jerome, one of
the Latin fathers of the fourth century. He was
both a preacher and a writer, and his greatest service
to the world was his translation of the Bible into
Latin (the Vulgate). This is the book from which
he is now reading, and St. George seems to look
over his shoulder. St. George is the hero saint who
rescued the princess Cleodolinda from the dragon.
He suffered many tortures at the orders of the Emperor
Diocletian, and was finally beheaded for his
faith.<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>We learn to identify these and other saints in the
old pictures by certain features which the masters
long ago agreed upon as appropriate to the characters.
St. Stephen we recognize here because he is
young, and carries a palm as the symbol of his martyrdom.
St. Jerome is always an old man and is
known here by his book, and St. George is distinguished
by his armor.</p>

<p>The three make an interesting group as they
represent three ages of man,&mdash;youth, maturity, and
old age. They stand, too, for distinctly different
temperaments. St. Stephen has the ardent imaginative
nature of a dreamer, St. George the active prosaic
temper of the warrior, and St. Jerome the grave
contemplative mind of the scholar. Each serves
the Christ with his own gift.</p>

<p>In the picture the three seem to be reading together
some passage referring to the birth of Christ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
perhaps that glorious verse from the prophet Isaiah,
&ldquo;Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.&rdquo;
Coming to the words &ldquo;Wonderful, Counsellor,&rdquo; St.
Stephen lifts his face adoringly.</p>

<p>The Child is innocently unconscious of his grave
guests. He lies across his mother&rsquo;s lap kicking his
feet gleefully and looking up to her with a playful,
appealing gesture. She bends over him smiling, and
the two seem to talk together in the mystic language
of babyhood. The artist, we see, painted the mother
as beautiful and the child as winsome as he could
well imagine them. He did not try to discover how
a woman of Judea was likely to have looked centuries
before. He preferred to think of Mary as one
of the beautiful Venetian women of his own day.
He may have seen some real mother and babe who
suggested the picture to him, but in that case he
painted them largely according to his own fancy.
The Madonna&rsquo;s dress is not according to any Venetian
fashions, but in the simple style chosen as most
appropriate by old masters. Red and blue were the
colors always used in her draperies, and it was also
an ancient custom to represent her as wearing a veil
over her head as befitting her modesty.</p>

<p>The mother has the fresh comely look of perfect
health, yet with much delicacy and refinement in
her gentle face. Both she and the babe seem to
rejoice in abounding health and vitality. The picture
is full of the joy of life.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="PHILIP_II" id="PHILIP_II"></a>
PHILIP II</p>

<p>Philip II. was the son of the Emperor Charles V.
and the <a href="#fig3">Empress Isabella</a>, whose portrait we have
seen. He had therefore, like most princes, a union of
several nationalities in his lineage. Upon his birth
in 1527, all Spain rejoiced that there was now an heir
to the throne. Charles himself counted eagerly upon
the help his son would give him in the administration
of his vast dominions.</p>

<p>From the first Philip was a grave and thoughtful
child, pursuing his studies first with his mother and
then with a tutor. When he was twelve years old
his mother died; and two years later his father, who
had scarcely seen the boy, returned to Spain, and
devoted himself for a while to teaching him the
principles of government. Philip was an apt pupil,
and showed great fondness for statesmanship.</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen a great responsibility fell upon
the young prince. Charles was called to Germany
and left Philip as regent of Spain. A marriage had
already been arranged between the youth and his
cousin Mary of Portugal, and this took place soon
after the Emperor&rsquo;s departure. Philip&rsquo;s regency was
eminently successful, and he won the lasting affection
and loyalty of the Spanish people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor now planned that the prince should
make a journey through the empire to become acquainted
with his future subjects. The Spanish
parted with him reluctantly, and he set forth accompanied
by a great train of courtiers. Six months
he was on his way, everywhere greeted by festivals,
banquets and tourneys. Philip, being of a reticent
and sombre nature, had little taste for these festivities,
but having political ambition, submitted as
gracefully as possible. At length he made a state
entry into Brussels. This was in 1548; and in the
two years that followed, the emperor and prince were
together, planning their future policy of government.
The lessons which Charles most deeply impressed
upon Philip were those of self-repression,
patience and distrust. The leading element in his
policy was to be absolute ruler.</p>

<p>It was at the close of these two years, that is, in
1550, that the emperor, attending a diet in Augsburg,
summoned thither Titian to paint the portrait
of Philip. The prince was now in his twenty-fourth
year, and stood, as it were, on the threshold of his
great career. There could scarcely be a more unattractive
subject for a portrait. Philip had a poor
figure, with narrow chest and large ungainly feet,
and his features were exceedingly ill-formed. His
eyes were large and bulging, he had a projecting jaw
and full fleshy lips which his scanty beard could not
conceal. Titian, however, had the great artist&rsquo;s gift
of making the most of a subject. We forget all
Philip&rsquo;s defects when we look at this magnificent
portrait.</p>

<p>The skill with which the splendid costume is
painted would alone make the picture a great work
of art. Philip wears a breastplate and hip pieces
of armor, richly inlaid with gold, slashed embroidered
hose, as the short trousers are called, white silk
tights and white slippers. The collar of the Golden
Fleece is the crowning ornament.</p>

<p>The attitude of the prince is full of dignity. He
stands in front of a table on which his helmet and
gauntlets are laid. The right hand rests on the
helmet, and the left holds the hilt of the rapier
which hangs at his side.</p>

<p>The most remarkable quality in the portrait is the
impression of royalty it conveys. Though Philip
has little to boast of in good looks, he has inherited
from generations of royal ancestors that indefinable
air of distinction which belongs to his station. It
is this which the painter has expressed in his attitude
and bearing.</p>

<p>Young as the face is, with little of life&rsquo;s experience
to give it individuality, the painter makes it a revelation
of the leading elements in Philip&rsquo;s character.
The seriousness of the boy has developed into the
habitual gravity of the man. Already we see how
well the father&rsquo;s lessons have been learned, how self-contained
and cautious the prince has become. The
affairs of state seem to weigh heavily upon him.</p>

<p>The proportions of the figure to the size and
shape of the canvas add something to the apparent
height of Philip. Titian has done everything a
painter could do to give an ill-favored prince an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
appearance befitting his royal prestige: it is a kingly
portrait.</p>

<p>Three years after it was painted, the picture was
sent to England to be shown to Queen Mary. Philip,
now a widower, had become a suitor of the English
queen. The report came that Mary was &ldquo;greatly
enamoured&rdquo; of the portrait, and the marriage was
soon after effected. Philip, however, did not win
great favor with the English, and after Mary&rsquo;s death
he chose a French princess for his next wife, and
spent his life in Spain.</p>

<p>Upon the abdication of his father, he became the
most powerful monarch in Europe, and had the best
armies of his time. He was constantly at war with
other nations, usually two or more at a time, and by
undertaking too many schemes often failed. It was
during his reign that the Netherlands were lost to
Spain, and the famous Spanish Armada was destroyed
by the English.</p>

SAINT CHRISTOPHER</p>

<p>There was once in the land of Canaan a giant
named Offero, which means &ldquo;the bearer.&rdquo; His
colossal size and tremendous strength made him an
object of terror to all beholders, and he determined
to serve none but the most powerful being in the
world.</p>

<p>He accordingly joined the retinue of a great king,
and for a while all went well. One day while listening
to a minstrel&rsquo;s song, the king trembled and
crossed himself every time the singer mentioned the
Devil. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; thought Offero, &ldquo;there is one more
powerful than the King; and he it is whom I should
serve.&rdquo; So he went in search of the Devil, and soon
entered the ranks of his army.</p>

<p>One day as they came to a wayside cross he noticed
his master tremble and turn aside. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; thought
Offero, &ldquo;there is one more powerful than the Devil,
and he it is whom I should serve.&rdquo; He now learned
that this greater being whom the Devil feared was
Jesus, who died on the cross, and he earnestly sought
to know the new Master.</p>

<p>An old hermit undertook to instruct him in the
faith. &ldquo;You must fast,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That I will
not,&rdquo; said Offero, &ldquo;lest I lose my strength.&rdquo; "You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
must pray," said the hermit. &ldquo;That I cannot,&rdquo; said
Offero. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;go to the river
side and save those who perish in the stream.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; said Offero joyfully.</p>

<p>The giant built him a hut on the bank and rooted
up a palm tree from the forest to use as a staff. Day
and night he guided strangers across the ford and
carried the weak on his shoulders. He never wearied
of his labor.</p>

<p>One night as he rested in his hut he heard a
child&rsquo;s voice calling to him from the shore, &ldquo;Offero,
come forth, and carry me over.&rdquo; He arose and went
out, but seeing nothing returned and lay down.
Again the voice called, &ldquo;Offero, come forth and carry
me over.&rdquo; Again he went out and saw no one. A
third time the voice came, &ldquo;Offero, come forth, and
carry me over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant now took a lantern, and by its light
found a little child sitting on the bank, repeating the
cry, &ldquo;Offero, carry me over.&rdquo; Offero lifted the child
to his great shoulders, and taking his staff strode
into the river. The wind blew, the waves roared,
and the water rose higher and higher, yet the giant
pushed bravely on. The burden which had at first
seemed so light grew heavier and heavier. Offero&rsquo;s
strong knees bent under him, and it seemed as if he
would sink beneath the load. Yet on he pressed
with tottering steps, never complaining, until at last
the farther bank was reached. Here he set his precious
burden gently down, and looking with wonder
at the child, asked, &ldquo;Who art thou, child? The
burden of the world had not been heavier.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wonder
not,&rdquo; said the Child, &ldquo;for thou hast borne on
thy shoulders him who made the world.&rdquo; Then a
bright light shone about the little face, and in another
moment the mysterious stranger had vanished.
Thus was it made known to Offero that he had been
taken into the service of the most powerful being in
the world. From this time forth he was known as

<p>With this story in mind we readily see the meaning
of our picture. The giant has reached mid-stream,
with his tiny passenger perched astride his
shoulders. Already the burden has become mysteriously
heavy, and Offero bends forward to support
the strain, staying himself with his great staff. He
lifts his face to the child&rsquo;s with an expression of
mingled anguish and wonder.</p>

<p>The situation is full of strange pathos. The babe
seems so small and helpless beside the splendid
muscular strength of the brawny giant. Yet he is
here the leader. With uplifted hand he seems to
be cheering his bearer on the toilsome way.</p>

<p>The figures in the picture seem to be taken from
common every-day life. Some Venetian boatman
may have been the painter&rsquo;s model for St. Christopher,
whose attitude is similar to that of a gondolier
plying his oar. The child, too, is a child of the people,
a sturdy little fellow, quite at ease in his perilous
position. We shall understand better the range
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of Titian&rsquo;s art by contrasting these more commonplace
figures with the refined and elegant types we
see in some of our other illustrations.</p>

<p>The picture of St. Christopher is a fresco painting
on the walls of the palace of the doges or dukes
in Venice. It was originally designed to celebrate
the arrival of the French army in 1523, at an Italian
town called San Cristoforo. It is so placed that
it might be the first object seen every morning when
the doge left his bed-chamber. This was on account
of an old tradition that the sight of St. Christopher
always gives courage to the beholder. &ldquo;Whoever
shall behold the image of St. Christopher, on that
day shall not faint or fail,&rdquo; runs an old Latin
inscription.</p>

<p>As fresco painting was a method of art comparatively
unfamiliar to Titian, it is interesting to know
than an eminent critic pronounces our picture
&ldquo;broad and solid in execution, rich and brilliant in
color.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
We see from our reproduction that the
paint has flaked from the wall in a few places.</p>

LAVINIA</p>

<p>Something of the home life of Titian must be
known in order to understand the loving care which
he bestowed upon this portrait of his daughter Lavinia.
The painter&rsquo;s works were in such demand that he
could afford to live in a costly manner. He had a
true Venetian&rsquo;s love of luxury, and liked to surround
himself with elegant things. His society was sought
by rich noblemen, and he himself lived like a prince.</p>

<p>When somewhat over fifty years of age Titian
removed to a spot just outside Venice in the district
of Biri, where he laid out a beautiful garden. The
view from Casa Grande, as the house was called,
was very extensive, looking across the lagoon to
the island of Murano and the hills of Ceneda. Here
Titian entertained his guests with lavish hospitality.
A distinguished scholar of that time, one Priscianese,
who had come to Venice in 1540 to publish a
grammar, describes how he was entertained there:
&ldquo;Before the tables were set out,&rdquo; he writes, &#8230; &ldquo;we
spent the time in looking at the lively figures
in the excellent pictures, of which the house was
full, and in discussing the real beauty and charm of
the garden&#8230;. In the meanwhile came the hour
for supper, which was no less beautiful and well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
arranged than copious and well provided. Besides
the most delicate viands and precious wines, there
were all those pleasures and amusements that are
suited to the season, the guests and the feast&#8230;. The
sea, as soon as the sun went down, swarmed
with gondolas, adorned with beautiful women, and
resounded with the varied harmony of music of
voices and instruments, which till midnight accompanied
our delightful supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The darling of this beautiful home at Casa
Grande was the painter&rsquo;s daughter Lavinia, and the
portrait shows how she looked in 1549. Her mother
had died before the removal of the family to
Biri, and the aunt, who had since tried to fill the
vacant place, died about the time this portrait was
painted. A new responsibility had therefore fallen
upon the young girl, and she was now her father&rsquo;s
chief consolation. It is thought that the picture
was painted for Titian&rsquo;s friend Argentina Pallavicino
of Reggio. As a guest at her father&rsquo;s house this
gentleman must often have seen and admired the
charming girl, and the portrait was a pleasant souvenir
of his visits.</p>

<p>Lavinia is seen carrying a silver salver of fruit,
turning, as she goes, to look over her shoulder. The
open country stretches before her, and it is as if she
were stepping from a portico of the house to the garden
terrace to bring the fruit to some guest. She is
handsomely dressed, as her father would like to see
his daughter. The gown is of yellow flowered brocade,
the bodice edged with jewelled cording. Over
the neck is thrown a delicate scarf of some gauzy
stuff, the ends floating down in front. An ornamental
gold tiara is set on the wavy auburn hair, an
ear-ring hangs from the pretty ear, and a string of
pearls encircles the neck. Imagine the figure against
a deep red curtain, and you have in mind the whole
color scheme of this richly decorative picture.</p>

<p>Lavinia, however, would be attractive in any dress,
with her fresh young beauty and simple unconscious
grace. Her features are not modelled in classic lines:
the charm of the face is its fresh color, the pretty
curves of the plump cheek, and, above all, the sweet
open expression. The hands are delicate and shapely,
as of one well born and gently reared. Lavinia is
perhaps not a very intellectual person, but she has
a sweet sunny nature and is full of life and spirits.
It would seem impossible to be sad or lonely in her
cheery company. She holds her precious burden
high, with an air of triumph, and turns with a smile
to see it duly admired. The delicious fruit certainly
makes a tempting display. The girl&rsquo;s innocent round
face and arch pose remind one of a playful kitten.</p>

<p>The painter has chosen a graceful and unusual
attitude. The curves of the outstretched arms serve
as counterbalancing lines to the main lines of the
figure. The artist himself was so pleased with the
pose that he repeated it in another picture, where
Lavinia assumes the gruesome rôle of Salome, and
carries in her salver, in place of the fruit, the head
of St. John the Baptist!</p>

<p>A few years after our portrait was painted, Lavinia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was betrothed to Cornelio Sarcinelli, of Serravalle,
and a new portrait was painted in honor of the
event. When the marriage settlement was signed
Lavinia brought her husband a dowry of fourteen
hundred ducats, a royal sum in those days. The
wedding was on the 19th of June, 1555.</p>

<p>Some years after her marriage Lavinia again sat
to her father for her portrait. Her beauty, as we
have noted, was not of a lasting kind, and in the
passing years her fresh color faded, and she became
far too stout for grace. Yet the frank nature always
made her attractive, and it is pleasant to see in the
kindly face the fulfilment of the happy promise of
her girlhood.</p>

CHRIST OF THE TRIBUTE MONEY</p>

<p>During the three years of Christ&rsquo;s ministry, his
words and actions were closely watched by his enemies,
who hoped to find some fault of which they
could accuse him. Not a flaw could be seen in that
blameless life, and it was only by some trick that
they could get him into their power.</p>

<p>One plan that they devised was very cunning.
Palestine was at that time a province of the Roman
empire, and the popular party among the Jews chafed
at having to pay tribute to the emperor C&#230;sar. On
the other hand the presence of the Roman governor
in Jerusalem made it dangerous to express any open
rebellion. Jesus was the friend of the people, and
many of his followers believed that he would eventually
lead them to throw off the Roman yoke. As
a matter of fact, however, he had taken no part in
political discussions.</p>

<p>His enemies now determined to make him commit
himself to one party or the other. If he declared
himself for Rome, his popularity was lost; if against
Rome he was liable to arrest. The evangelists
relate how shrewdly their question was framed to
force a compromising reply, and how completely he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
silenced them with his twofold answer. This is the
story:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how
they might entangle him in his talk. And they
sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and
teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou
for any man: for thou regardest not the person of
men. Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is
it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,
Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Shew me the
tribute money. And they brought unto him a
penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this
image and superscription? They say unto him,
Cæsar&rsquo;s. Then saith he unto them, Render, therefore,
unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar&rsquo;s; and
unto God the things that are God&rsquo;s. When they
had heard these words, they marvelled and left him,
and went their way.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_13"
id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>That was indeed a wonderful scene, and it is
made quite real to us in our picture: Christ and the
Pharisee stand face to face, engaged in conversation.
A wily old fellow has been chosen spokesman for
his party. His bronzed skin and hairy muscular
arm show him to be of a common class of laborers.
The face is seamed with toil, and he has the hooked,
aquiline nose of his race. As he peers into the face
of his supposed dupe, his expression is full of low
cunning and hypocrisy. He holds between thumb
and forefinger the Roman coin which Christ has
called for, and looks up as if wondering what that
has to do with the question.</p>

<p>Christ turns upon him a searching glance which
seems to read his motives as an open page. There
is no indignation in the expression, only sorrowful
rebuke. His answer is ready, and he points quietly
to the coin with the words which so astonish his
listeners.</p>

<p>The character of Christ is so many-sided that any
painter who tries to represent him has the difficult
task of uniting in a single face all noble qualities of
manhood. Let us notice what elements of character
Titian has made most prominent, and we shall see
how much more nearly he satisfies our ideal than
other painters.</p>

<p>Refinement and intellectual power impress us first
in this countenance: the noble forehead is that of
a thinker. The eyes show penetration and insight:
we feel how impossible it would be to deceive this
man. It is a gentle face, too, but without weakness.
Here is one who would sympathize with the
sorrowing and have compassion on the erring, but
who would not forget to be just. Strength of
character and firmness of purpose are indicated in
his expression. The highest quality in the face is
its moral earnestness. Its calm purity contrasts
with the coarse, evil face of the questioner as light
shining in the darkness. There is, perhaps, only
one other head of Christ in art with which it can
properly be compared, and this is by Leonardo da
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Vinci, in the Last Supper at Milan. The two
painters have expressed, as no others have been able
to, a spiritual majesty worthy of the subject.</p>

<p>The early painters used to surround the head of
Christ with a circle of gold, which was called a nimbus,
a halo, or a glory. The custom had been given
up by Titian&rsquo;s time, but we see in our picture the
remnant of the old symbol in the three tiny points
of light which shine over the top and sides of the
Saviour&rsquo;s hair. They are a mystic emblem of the
Trinity.</p>

<p>The artistic qualities of the picture are above
praise. There are few, if any, of Titian&rsquo;s works
executed with so much care and delicacy of finish,
but without sacrificing anything in the breadth.
We recognize the painter&rsquo;s characteristic touch in
the disposition of the draperies, in the delicacy of
the hair, the modelling of the hands, and the pose
of Christ&rsquo;s head. The figures have that quality of
vitality which we observe in Titian&rsquo;s great portraits.
The color of Christ&rsquo;s robe is red, and his mantle a
deep blue.</p>

<p class="caption1">IX</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="THE_BELLA" id="THE_BELLA"></a>
THE BELLA</p>

<p>Among Titian&rsquo;s wealthy patrons was a certain
Duke of Urbino, Francesco Maria della Rovere, who,
as the general-in-chief of the Venetian forces, came
to Venice to live when our artist was at the height
of his fame. From this time till the Duke&rsquo;s death
the painter was brought into relations with this noble
family. This was the period when the Bella was
painted, and the picture has, as we shall see, an intimate
connection with these patrons.</p>

<p>The Duke&rsquo;s wife was Eleanora Gonzaga, sister of
the Duke of Mantua, celebrated for her beauty and
refinement. A contemporary (Baldassare Castiglione)
writing of the lady, says: &ldquo;If ever there were united
wisdom, grace, beauty, genius, courtesy, gentleness,
and refined manners, it was in her person, where
these combined qualities form a chain adorning her
every movement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Duke himself was deeply in love with his wife.
A week after his marriage he wrote that &ldquo;he had
never met a more comely, merry, or sweet girl,
who to a most amiable disposition added a surprisingly
precocious judgment, which gained for her
general admiration.&rdquo; Eleanora, on her part A showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
an undeviating affection for her husband, and they
lived together happily.</p>

<p>From the date of her marriage, we can reckon
that the Duchess must have been well into her thirties
when she came to Venice to live. From a portrait
Titian painted of her, when she was about forty,
we see that much of the fresh beauty of her girlhood
had faded. She had, however, good features, with
large, fine eyes and arching brows. Her figure was
graceful and her neck beautiful: the head was particularly
well set.</p>

<p>All these qualities kindled the artistic imagination
of Titian. In the matron of forty his inner eye
caught a vision of the belle of twenty. Thereupon,
he wrought an artist&rsquo;s miracle: he painted pictures
of Eleanora as she had looked twenty years before.
One of these, and perhaps the most famous, is the
Bella of our illustration.<a name="FNanchor_1_14"
id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The identity of the original
is hidden under this simple title, which is an
Italian word, meaning the Beauty. An ancient
legend tells of a wonderful fountain, by drinking of
which a man, though old, might renew his youth
and be, like the gods, immortal. There were some
who went in quest of these waters, among them, as
we remember, the Spanish knight, Ponce de Leon,
who, thinking to find them north of Cuba, discovered
our Florida. The Duchess of Urbino found such a
fountain of youth in the art of Titian. Comparing
her actual portrait with the Bella, painted within a
few years, it seems as if the lady of the former had
quaffed the magic draught which had restored her
to her youthful beauty.</p>

<p>The Bella is what is called a half length portrait,
the figure standing, tall, slender, and perfectly proportioned.
The lady turns her face to meet ours,
and whether we move to the right or the left, the
eyes of the enchantress seem to follow us. We fall
under their spell at the first glance; there is a delightful
witchery about them.</p>

<p>The small head is exquisitely modelled, and the
hair is coiled about it in close braids to preserve the
round contours corresponding to the faultless curves
of cheek and chin. The hair is of golden auburn,
waving prettily about the face, and escaping here
and there in little tendrils. Over the forehead it
forms the same perfect arch which is repeated in the
brows. The slender throat is long and round, like
the stalk of a flower; the neck and shoulders are
white and firm, and shaped in beautiful curves.</p>

<p>The rich costume interests us as indicating the
fashions in the best Venetian society of the early
16th century. Comparing it with that of the Empress
Isabella in our other picture,<a name="FNanchor_1_15"
id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a> we notice that at
the same period the Venetian styles differed considerably
from the Spanish, to the advantage of the former.
Instead of the stiff Spanish corset which destroyed
the natural grace of the figure, the Bella wears
a comfortably fitting bodice, from which the skirt
falls in full straight folds. The dress is of brownish<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
purple velvet, combined with peacock blue brocade.
The sleeves are ornamented with small knots pulled
through slashes. A long chain falls across the
neck, and jewelled ear-rings hang in the ears.<a
name="FNanchor_2_16" id="FNanchor_2_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_2_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It is pleasant to analyze the details of the figure
and costume, but after all the charm of the picture
is in the total impression it conveys. Applied to this
lovely vision of womanhood the words of Castiglione
seem no flattery. In her are united &ldquo;grace, beauty,
courtesy, gentleness, and refined manners.&rdquo; The
essence of aristocracy is expressed in her bearing:
the pose of the head is that of a princess. There
is no trace of haughtiness in her manner, and no
approach to familiarity: she has the perfect equipoise
of good breeding.</p>

<p>The picture gives us that sense of a real presence
which it was the crowning glory of Titian&rsquo;s art to
achieve. The canvas is much injured, but the Bella
is still immortally young and beautiful.</p>

<p>A charming story is told in Ovid&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo;
of Jason&rsquo;s adventures in search of the golden
fleece, and of his love for Medea.<a name="FNanchor_1_17"
id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Jason was a
Greek prince, young, handsome, brave, and withal
of noble heart. He had journeyed over seas in his
good ship Argo, and had at last come to Colchis to
win the coveted treasure.</p>

<p>The King &#198;ëtes had no mind to give up the
fleece without a struggle, and he set the young hero
a hard task. He was ordered to tame two bulls
which had feet of brass and breath of flame. When
he had yoked these, he was to plough a field and
sow it with serpent&rsquo;s teeth which would yield a crop
of armed men to attack him. While Jason turned
over in his mind how he should perform these feats,
he chanced to meet the king&rsquo;s beautiful daughter
Medea. At once the two fell in love with each other,
and Jason&rsquo;s fortunes took a new turn. Medea possessed
certain secrets of enchantment which might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
be of practical service to her lover in his adventure.
She had a magic salve which protected the body
from fire and steel. She also knew the charm&mdash;and
it was merely the throwing of a stone&mdash;which
would turn the &ldquo;earth-born crop of foes&rdquo; from attacking
an enemy to attack one another. Finally
she had drugs which would put to sleep the dragon
guarding the fleece.</p>

<p>To impart these secrets to Jason might seem an
easy matter, but Medea did not find it so. She was
a loyal daughter, and Jason had come to take her
father&rsquo;s prized possession. She would be a traitor
to aid a stranger against her own people. The poet
tells how in her trouble the princess sought a quiet
spot where she might take counsel with herself.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p style="margin:0 0 0 9em;">&ldquo;In vain,&rdquo; she cried,</p>
<p class="poem1" style="text-indent:-.5em">&ldquo;Medea! dost thou strive! Some deity</p>
<p class="poem1">Resists thee! Ah, this passion sure, or one</p>
<p class="poem1">Resembling this, must be what men call love!</p>
<p class="poem1">Why should my sire&rsquo;s conditions seem too hard?</p>
<p class="poem1">And yet too hard they are! Why should I shake</p>
<p class="poem1">And tremble for the fate of one whom scarce</p>
<p class="poem1">These eyes have looked on twice? Whence comes this fear</p>
<p class="poem1">I cannot quell? Unhappy! from thy breast</p>
<p class="poem1">Dash out these new-lit fires!&mdash;Ah! wiser far</p>
<p class="poem1">If so I could!&mdash;But some new power constrains,</p>
<p class="poem1">And reason this way points, and that way, love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The struggle goes on for some time, and the maiden&rsquo;s
heart is torn with conflicting impulses. Summoning
up &ldquo;all images of right and faith and shame
and natural duty,&rdquo; she fancies that her love is conquered.
A moment later Jason crosses her path and
the day is lost. Together they pledge their vows at
the shrine of Hecate, and in due time they sail away
in the Argo with the golden fleece.</p>

<p>Our picture illustrates the scene of Medea&rsquo;s temptation
at the fountain. The tempter is love, in the
form of Venus, the Greek goddess represented in the
old mythology as the inspirer of the tender passion.
She is accompanied by the little love-god Cupid, the
mischievous fellow whose bow and arrow work so
much havoc in human hearts. The perplexed princess
sits beside the fountain, holding her head in the
attitude of one listening. Venus leans towards her
from the other side and softly pleads the lover&rsquo;s
cause. Cupid paddles in the water as if quite unconcerned
in the affair, but none can tell what mischief
he is plotting.</p>

<p>We notice a distinct resemblance between the faces
of the two maidens, and perhaps this is the painter&rsquo;s
way of telling us that Venus is only Medea&rsquo;s other
self: the voice of the tempter speaks from her own
heart. The expression is quite different on the two
faces, tender and persuasive in Venus, dreamy and
preoccupied in Medea. If we turn again to Ovid
for the interpretation of the picture, we may fancy
that Venus is describing the proud days when, as
Jason&rsquo;s bride, Medea would journey with him through
the cities of Greece. &ldquo;My head will touch the very
stars with rapture,&rdquo; thought the princess.</p>

<p>The dress of Medea is rich and elegant, but quite
simply made; the heavy folds of the skirt describe
long, beautiful lines. In one gloved hand she holds
a bunch of herbs, and the other rests upon a casket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The figure of Venus is conceived according to classic
tradition, undraped, as the goddess emerged from
the sea-foam at her birth. In the Greek religion
the human body was honored as a fit incarnation
for the deities. Sculptors delighted in the long flowing
lines and beautiful curves which could be developed
in different poses. Titian&rsquo;s picture translates
the spirit of Greek sculpture, so to speak, into the
art of painting. The figure of Venus may well be
compared with the marble Venus of Milo, in the
pure beauty of the face, the exquisite modelling of
the figure, and the sweeping lines of grace described
in the attitude.<a name="FNanchor_1_18"
id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The painter contrasts the delicate
tint of the flesh with the rich crimson of the mantle
which falls from the shoulder.</p>

<p>The landscape is a charming part of the picture,
stretching on either side in sunny vistas, pleasantly
diversified with woods and waters, hills and pasture
lands, church and castle.<a name="FNanchor_2_19"

THE MAN WITH THE GLOVE</p>

<p>The Man with the Glove is so called for lack of
a more definite name. Nothing is told by Titian&rsquo;s
biographers about the original of the portrait, and
the mystery gives a certain romantic interest to the
picture. Not being limited by any actual facts we
can invent a story of our own about the person, or
as many stories as we like, each according to his
fancy.</p>

<p>The sitter certainly makes a good figure for the
hero of a romance. He is young and handsome,
well dressed, with an unmistakable air of breeding,
and singularly expressive eyes. Such eyes usually
belong to a shy, sensitive nature, and have a haunting
quality like those of some woodland creature.</p>

<p>The title of The Man with the Glove is appropriate
in emphasizing an important feature of the costume.
In the days of this portrait, gloves were worn only
by persons of wealth and distinction, and were a
distinguishing mark of elegance. Though somewhat
clumsily made, according to our modern notions,
they were large enough to preserve the characteristic
shape of the hand, and give easy play to the fingers.
They formed, too, a poetic element in the social life
of the age of chivalry. It was by throwing down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
his glove (or gauntlet) that one knight challenged
another; while a glove was also sometimes a love-token
between a knight and his lady.</p>

<p>The glove has its artistic purpose in the picture,
casting the left hand into shadow, to contrast with
the ungloved right hand. The texture of the leather
is skilfully rendered, and harmonizes pleasantly with
the serious color scheme of the composition.</p>

<p>Besides the gloves, the daintily ruffled shirt, the
seal ring, and the long neck chain, show the sitter
to be a young man of fashion. Not that he is in the
least a fop, but he belongs to that station in life
where fine raiment is a matter of course, and he
wears it as one to the manner born. His hands are
delicately modelled, but they are not the plump hands
of an idler. They are rather flexible and sensitive,
with long fingers like the hands of an artist.</p>

<p>The glossy hair falls over the ears, and is brushed
forward and cut in a straight line across the forehead.
The style suits well the open frankness of the countenance.
We must note Titian&rsquo;s rendering of both
hair and hands as points of excellence in the portrait.
There is a great deal of individuality in the texture
of a person&rsquo;s hair and the shape of his hands, but
many artists have apparently overlooked this fact.
Van Dyck, for instance, used a model who furnished
the hands for his portraits, irrespective of the sitter.
Titian, in his best work, counted nothing too trivial
for faithful artistic treatment.</p>

<p>If we were to try to explain why The Man with
the Glove is a great work of art we should find the
first reason, perhaps, in the fact that the man seems
actually alive. The portrait has what the critics call
vitality, in a remarkable degree. Again, the painter
has revealed in the face the inner life of the man
himself; the portrait is a revelation of his personality.</p>

<p>It has been said that every man wears an habitual
mask in the presence of his fellows. It is only when
he is taken unaware that the mask drops, and the
man&rsquo;s real self looks out of his face. The portrait
painter&rsquo;s art must catch the sitter&rsquo;s expression in
such a moment of unconsciousness. The great artist
must be a seer as well as a painter, to penetrate the
secrets of human character.</p>

<p>The young man of our picture is one of those
reticent natures capable of intense feeling. In this
moment of unconsciousness his very soul seems to
look forth from his eyes. It is the soul of a poet,
though he may not possess the gift of song. He
has the poet&rsquo;s imagination as a dreamer of noble
dreams.</p>

<p>The time seems to have come when he is just
awakening to the possibilities of life. He faces the
future seriously, but with no shrinking. One recalls
the words of Gareth, in Tennyson&rsquo;s Idyll:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="poem1" style="text-indent:-.5em;">&ldquo;Man am I grown, a man&rsquo;s work must I do.</p>

<p>The lofty ideals of the knights of King Arthur&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Round Table are such as we feel sure this gentle spirit
would make his own:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="poem1" style="text-indent:-.5em;">&ldquo;To reverence the king as if he were</p>
<p class="poem1">Their conscience, and their conscience as their king,</p>

<p>It may be of these &ldquo;noble deeds&rdquo; of chivalry
that our young man is dreaming, or it may be of
that &ldquo;one maiden &rdquo; for whose sake they are to be
done. Certainly these candid eyes see visions which
we should be glad to see, and show us the depths of
a knightly soul.</p>

THE ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN</p>

<p class="caption3">(<i>Detail</i>)</p>

<p>The Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus, has for over
nineteen centuries represented to Christendom all
the ideal qualities of womanhood. In her character,
as revealed in St. Luke&rsquo;s gospel, we read of her
noble, trustful humility in accepting the message of
the Annunciation; of her decision and prudence
shown in her visit to Elizabeth; of her intellectual
power as manifested in the song of the Magnificat;
of the contemplative nature with which she watched
the growth of Jesus; of her maternal devotion
throughout her son&rsquo;s ministry,&mdash;and of her sublime
fortitude and faith at his crucifixion.<a name="FNanchor_1_22"
id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Such was the
woman so highly favored of God, she whom the
angel called &ldquo;blessed among women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Art has pictured for us many imaginary scenes
from the life of Mary. The most familiar and best
loved subject is that of her motherhood, where she
is seen with her babe in her arms. There are other
subjects, less common, showing her as a glorified
figure in mid-air as in a vision. One such is that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
called the Immaculate Conception, which the Spanish
painter Murillo so frequently repeated.<a name="FNanchor_1_23"
id="FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Another
is the Assumption, representing her at her
death as borne by angels to heaven.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Golden Legend &rdquo; relates how &ldquo; the right
fair among the daughters of Jerusalem &#8230; full of
charity and dilection&rdquo; was &ldquo;joyously received&rdquo; into
glory. &ldquo;The angels were glad, the archangels
enjoyed, the thrones sang, the dominations made
melody, the principalities harmonized, the potestates
harped, cherubim and seraphim sang laudings and
praisings.&rdquo; Also, &ldquo;the angels were with the apostles
singing, and replenished all the land with marvelous
sweetness.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_24" id="FNanchor_2_24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The Assumption of the Virgin is the subject of a
noble painting by Titian, one of the most celebrated
pictures in the world. A group of apostles stand on
the earth gazing after the receding figure of the
Virgin as she soars into the air on a wreath of cloud-
borne angels. From the upper air the Heavenly
Father floats downward with his angels to receive
her. As the canvas is very large, over twenty-two
feet in height, a small reproduction of the entire
picture is unsatisfactory, and our illustration gives
us the heart of the composition for careful study.</p>

<p>The Virgin rises buoyantly through the air, and
the figure is so full of life and motion that it seems
as if it would presently soar beyond our sight. The
heavy folds of the skirt swirl about the body in
the swiftness of the ascent. The rushing air fills
the mantle like the sail of a ship. Yet the source of
motion is not within the figure itself, for we see the
feet resting firmly on the cloud. It is as if she were
borne aloft in a celestial chariot composed of an
angelic host.</p>

<p>The face is lifted with a look of rapture; the
arms are extended in a gesture of exultation. The
pose of the head displays the beautiful throat, strong
and full like that of a singer. The features are cast
in a large, majestic mould. The hands, turned palm
outward, are large and flexible, but with delicate,
tapering fingers.</p>

<p>We have already seen in other pictures what was
Titian&rsquo;s conception of the Virgin in her girlhood
and motherhood. We find little of the ethereal and
spiritual in his ideal, and nothing that would in any
way suggest that true piety is morbid or sentimental.
Other painters have erred in this direction, but not
Titian. To him the Virgin was no angel in disguise,
but a strong, happy, healthy woman, rejoicing in
life. But though a woman, she was in the poet&rsquo;s
phrase &ldquo;a woman above all women glorified.&rdquo; She
possessed in perfection all the good gifts of human
nature. Titian&rsquo;s ideal coincided with the old Greek
formula, &ldquo;A sound mind in a sound body.&rdquo; The
Virgin of the Assumption is in fact not unlike a
Greek goddess in her magnificently developed physique
and glorious beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Our illustration includes a few of the baby angels
from the wreath supporting the Madonna. They
are packed so closely together in the picture that
their little limbs interlace like interwoven stems in a
garland of flowers. Yet the figures are cunningly
arranged to bring into prominence a series of radiating
lines which flow towards a centre in the Madonna&rsquo;s
face. We see in the corner of our print a little
arm pointing to the Virgin, and above it is a cherub&rsquo;s
wing drawn in the same oblique line.</p>

<p>Frolicsome as is this whole company of angels,
they are of an almost unearthly beauty. A poetic
critic has told of standing before the picture contemplating
these lovely spirits one after another, until,
as she expresses it, &ldquo;A thrill came over me like that
which I felt when Mendelssohn played the organ
and I became music while I listened.&rdquo; She sums
up the effect of the picture as &ldquo;mind and music and
love, kneaded, as it were, into form and color.&rdquo;<a
name="FNanchor_1_25" id="FNanchor_1_25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>When we analyze the drawing of the Madonna&rsquo;s
figure we see that it is drawn in an outline of long,
beautiful curves. The principle of repetition is
skilfully worked into the composition. The outer
sleeve falls away from the right arm in an oval
which exactly duplicates that made by the lower
portion of the mantle sweeping out at one side. By
tracing the main lines of the drapery one will find
them running in parallels.</p>

<p class="caption1">XIII</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="FLORA" id="FLORA"></a>
FLORA</p>

<p>Besides the portraits intended as actual likenesses
of the sitters, Titian was fond of painting what may
be called ideal portraits, or fancy pictures. While
real persons furnished the original models for these,
the painter let his imagination have free play in
modifying and perfecting form and feature. We
have seen an illustration of this process in the picture
called the Bella, an idealized portrait of Eleanora
Gonzaga. The Flora is another example.</p>

<p>We do not know the name of the original, but
we may be sure that it represents an actual person.
There is a tradition that she was the daughter of
one of Titian&rsquo;s fellow-painters, Palma, with whom
he was in love. As a matter of fact, Palma had no
daughter, and the young woman was doubtless only
a favorite Venetian model whom both painters employed.
Apparently it was she who posed for both
figures in the picture of Medea and Venus which
we have studied.<a name="FNanchor_1_26"
id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Flora&rsquo;s hair is of that auburn tint which the Venetians
loved, and which, it is believed, was artificially
produced. It is looped into soft, waving puffs over
the ears, and gathered back by a silken cord, below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
which it falls like a delicate veil thinly spread over
the shoulders. The skin is exquisitely white and
soft, and the thin garment has been allowed to slip
from one shoulder so that we may see the full,
beautiful neck.</p>

<p>We notice with what art the painter has arranged
the draperies. From the right shoulder the garment
falls in delicate, radiating folds across the figure.
Over the garment is thrown a stiff, rose-colored brocade
mantle, contrasting pleasantly with the former
both in color and texture. A glimpse of this mantle
is seen at the right side and above the left shoulder
and arm, over which the hand gathers it up to prevent
it from slipping. This action of the left hand
introduces a new set of lines into the picture, breaking
the folds of the drapery into eddying circles which
offset the more sweeping lines of the composition.<a
name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The drawing here is well worth studying, and we
may give it more attention since we must lose the
lovely color of the painting in the reproduction.
The main lines flow in diagonals in two opposite
directions. There is the long line of the right arm
and shoulder drawn in a fine, strong curve across the
canvas. Parallel with it is the edge of the brocade
mantle as it is held in the left hand. The counter
lines are the curve of the neck and left shoulder,
with which the upper edge of the undergarment
runs parallel. The wide spaces between these enclosing
lines are broken by sprays of radiating lines,
one formed by the folds of the undergarment, and
the other smaller one by the locks of hair on the
left shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The graceful pose of the head, inclined to one
side, suggests the soft languor of a southern temperament.
It was often adopted by Titian, and we see
another instance in the attitude of the Venus. We
fancy that the painters liked particularly the long
curve thus obtained along the neck and shoulder.
The angle made on the other side between head and
shoulder is filled in with the falling hair.</p>

<p>The title of Flora is given to the picture after the
fashion of Titian&rsquo;s time for drawing subjects from
mythology. The revival of classic learning had
opened to Italian art a delightful new field of illustration.
We see how Titian took advantage of it
in such pictures as Medea and Venus. In England
the love of the classics was seen in the poetry which
took much the same place there that painting held
in Italy. Flora was the ancient goddess of flowers
and is made much of in Elizabethan verse.<a
name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Some pretty lines by Richard Carlton describe</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;When Flora fair the pleasant tidings bringeth<br />
Of summer sweet with herbs and flowers adorned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>In our picture the goddess holds a handful of
flowers, roses, jessamine and violets, as a sign of her
identity. We confess that her type of beauty hardly
corresponds to our ideal of Flora. She is a gentle,
amiable creature, but not ethereal and poetic enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
for the goddess of flowers. Were we to choose a
character for her from mythology it would be Juno,
the matronly &ldquo;ox-eyed&rdquo; goddess, who presided over
marriage and whose emblem was the productive
pomegranate.</p>

<p>As we compare Flora with the other fair women of
our collection, we see that her beauty is of a less
elegant and aristocratic type than that of the Bella,
and less delicate and refined than that of the Empress
Isabella. Her face is perhaps too broad to satisfy a
connoisseur of beauty, and she is quite plainly of
plebeian caste. Like Lavinia her charm is in the
healthy vitality which was the special characteristic
of the Venetian beauties of the time. The figure
glows with warm pulsing life.</p>

THE PESARO MADONNA</p>

<p>High on a great marble pedestal, between the
stately pillars of a temple, sits the mother Mary
with her child Jesus, receiving worshippers. Beyond
the pillars is seen the blue sky veiled with fleecy
clouds. A tiny cloud has floated within the enclosure,
bearing two winged cherubs, who hold a cross
between them, hovering over the group below.</p>

<p>The company of worshippers kneel on the tessellated
pavement: we see from their dress that they
are wealthy Venetians of the sixteenth century. It
is the family group of a certain Jacopo Pesaro, who
was at that time bishop of Paphos. He is known
by the familiar nickname of &ldquo;Baffo,&rdquo; and played
an important part in Venetian history.</p>

<p>When the Venetians went forth in the New Crusade
to attack the Turks, Pesaro or &ldquo;Baffo&rdquo; was
the commander of the galleys sent by the Borgia
pope Alexander VI. The expedition being successful,
the bishop wished to show his gratitude for
the divine favor. Accordingly, in the course of
time, he ordered this picture as a thank-offering
commemorative of his victory. He comes with his
kinsman Benedetto and other members of his family
to consecrate the standards taken from the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The bishop himself has the most prominent place
among the worshippers at the foot of the throne
steps, while Benedetto, with a group behind him,
kneels opposite. The victorious commander is accompanied
by St. George, who carries the banner
inscribed with the papal arms and the Pesaro escutcheon.
He leads forward two Turkish captives to
whom he turns to speak. St. George was a warrior
saint, and being besides the patron of Venice his
appearance in this capacity is very appropriate here.</p>

<p>There are other saints to lend their august presence
to the ceremony. As the picture was to be
given to a church dedicated to the Franciscan friars
or &ldquo;Frari,&rdquo; two of the most celebrated members of
this order are represented. They are St. Francis,
the founder, and St. Anthony, of Padua, the great
preacher, and they stand in the habits of their order
beside the throne. Midway on the steps St. Peter
is seated reading a book from which he turns to look
down upon Jacopo. The key, which is the symbol
of his authority in the church, stands on the step
below. The saints, we see, form a connecting link
between the exalted height of the Madonna and
Child and the worshippers. St. Peter introduces the
bishop, and St. Francis seems to ask favor for the
group with Benedetto.</p>

<p>The scene is full of pomp and grandeur. The
superb architecture of the temple, the rich draperies
of the sacred group, the splendid dresses of the
worshippers, the red and gold banner, all contribute
to the impression of magnificence which the picture
conveys. The colossal scale of the composition
gives us an exhilarating sense of spaciousness. The
color harmony is described as glorious.</p>

<p>Though the bishop of Paphos comes to render
thanks, his attitude is far from humble. There are
no bowed heads in the kneeling company. These
proud Pesari all hold themselves erect in conscious
self-importance. It is as if they were taking part
in some pageant. Only the face of the youth in
the corner relaxes from dignified impassivity and
looks wistfully out at us.</p>

<p>The Madonna leans graciously from her high
throne and looks into the face of the bishop. She,
too, has the proud aspect and demeanor which these
haughty Venetians would demand of one whom
they were to honor. Her splendid vitality is what
impresses us most forcibly. The child is a merry
little fellow who does not concern himself at all
with the ceremony. He has caught up his mother&rsquo;s
veil in the left hand, drawing it over his head as if
in a game of hide and seek with St. Francis. The
little foot is kicked out playfully as he looks down
into the good saint&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Let us consider a moment the skill with which
Titian has united the various parts of his picture.
The canvas was of an awkward shape, being of so
great height. To fill the space proportionately, the
Virgin&rsquo;s throne is placed at a height which divides
the picture. The little cloud-borne cherubs break
the otherwise undue length of the temple pillars.
The composition of the group is outlined in a rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
odd-shaped triangle. All its main lines flow diagonally
toward a focus in the face of the Virgin, who
is of course the dominant figure in the company.</p>

<p>Notice the continuous line extending from the top
to the bottom of the group. The folds of the Madonna&rsquo;s
drapery are ingeniously carried on in the
rich velvet throne hanging; and St. Peter&rsquo;s yellow
mantle falls well below, where the bishop&rsquo;s robe takes
up the lines and carries them to the pavement.
There is a veritable cascade of draperies flowing
diagonally through the centre of the picture. The
staff of the banner describes a line cutting this main
diagonal at exactly the same angle, and thus avoiding
any one-sided effect in the picture. In the right
of the composition the outline of the Christchild&rsquo;s
figure, the arm of St. Francis, and the stiff robe of
Benedetto make a series of lines which enclose the
triangle on that side.</p>

<p>The critic Ruskin has enunciated a set of laws of
composition nearly all of which find illustration in
this painting.<a name="FNanchor_1_29"
id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> <i>Principality</i> is well exemplified in
the prominence of the Virgin&rsquo;s position and the
flow of the lines toward her. <i>Repetition</i>, <i>Contrast</i>,
and <i>Continuity</i>, are seen in the drawing of the compositional
lines, as has been indicated. Finally, the
picture is perfect in <i>Unity</i>, which is the result of
masterly composition, its many diverse parts being
bound closely together to form a harmonious whole.</p>

ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST</p>

<p>St. John the Baptist was the cousin of Jesus, and
was the elder of the two by about six months. Before
his birth the angel Gabriel appeared to his
father, Zacharias, and predicted for the coming
child a great mission as a prophet. His special work
was to prepare the way for the advent of the Messiah.</p>

<p>Zacharias was a priest and a good man, and both
he and his wife Elizabeth were deeply impressed with
the angel&rsquo;s message. Not long after, their cousin
Mary came from Nazareth to bring them news of
the wonderful babe Jesus promised her by the same
angel. He was to be the Messiah whom John was
to proclaim. The two women talked earnestly together
of the future of their children, and no doubt
planned to do all in their power to further the
angel&rsquo;s prediction. The time came when all these
strange prophecies were fulfilled. As John grew
to manhood he showed himself quite different from
other men. He took up his abode in the wilderness,
where he lived almost as a hermit. His raiment
was of camel&rsquo;s hair fastened about him with
a leathern girdle; his food was locusts and wild
honey. At length "the word of God came unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
him," and he began to go about the country preaching.
His speech was as simple and rugged as his
manner of life. He boldly denounced the Pharisees
and Sadducees as &ldquo;a generation of vipers,&rdquo; and
warned sinners &ldquo;to flee from the wrath to come.&rdquo;
The burden of all his sermons was, &ldquo;Repent, for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fame of his preaching reached Jerusalem, and
the Jews sent priests and Levites to ask him, "Who
art thou? ' His reply was in the mystic language
of the old Hebrew prophet Isaiah, &ldquo;I am the Voice
of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the
way of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a part of John&rsquo;s work to baptize his converts
in the river Jordan. He explained, however, that
this baptism by water was only a symbol of the
spiritual baptism which they were to receive at the
hands of the coming: Messiah. &ldquo;One mightier than
I cometh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the latchet of whose shoes I
am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you
with the Holy Ghost and with fire.&rdquo;<a
name="FNanchor_1_30" id="FNanchor_1_30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>At last Jesus himself sought to be baptized by
John. The Baptist protested his unworthiness, but
Jesus insisted, and the ceremony was performed.
And &ldquo;it came to pass that &#8230; the heaven was
opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily
shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from
heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved son; in
thee I am well pleased.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_31"
id="FNanchor_2_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This was the promised
sign by which John knew Jesus as the Messiah, and
he straightway proclaimed him to his disciples.</p>

<p>His life work was now consummated, but he was
not permitted to see the fruits of his labors. For
his open denunciation of King Herod he was cast
into prison, and was soon after beheaded.</p>

<p>In our picture St. John stands in a mountain glen
preaching. As his glance is directed out of the picture
it is as if his audience were in front, and we
among their number. His pointing finger seems to
single out some one to whom he directs attention,
and we know well who it is. This must be that day
when seeing Jesus approach the prophet exclaimed,
&ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away
the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said,
After me cometh a man which is preferred before
me; for he was before me.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_32"
id="FNanchor_1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The lamb which lies
on the ground beside him is the outward symbol of
his words. The slender reed cross he carries is an
emblem of his mission as the prophet of the crucified
one.</p>

<p>From head to feet the Baptist impresses us with
his muscular power. There is no hint of fastings
and vigils in this strong athletic figure. Here, as
elsewhere. Titian will have nothing of that piety which
is associated with a delicate and puny physique. He
is the art apostle of that &ldquo;muscular Christianity&rdquo; of
which Charles Kingsley used to preach. The Baptist&rsquo;s
skin is bronzed and weather-beaten from his
active out-of-door life. Yet the face shows the stern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and sombre character of the prophet. There are
traces of suffering in the expression, as of one who
mourns profoundly the evil in the world. Something
of the fanatic gleams in the eyes, and the
effect is heightened by the wild masses of unkempt
hair which frame the countenance.</p>

<p>Nature too seems to be in a somewhat wild and
sombre mood in this spot. A dark bank rises abruptly
at the side, and St. John stands in its shadow,
just under a tuft of coarse grass and bushes jutting
from its upper edge. The sky is overcast with
clouds. A narrow stream falls over a rocky bed,
and in the distance slender trees lift their feathery
branches in the air. In Titian&rsquo;s time landscape
painting had not developed into an independent art,
but was an important part of figure compositions.
Our painter always took great pains with his landscapes,
making them harmonize, as does this, with
the character of the figures.</p>

<p>The picture reminds us of the St. Christopher
which we have examined, being, like it, a study direct
from the life of some athletic model. Yet here
we see to better advantage Titian&rsquo;s work in modelling
the nude figure. We can understand that one
reason why he could make a draped figure so lifelike
was because he studied the anatomy of the human
body in undraped models. The figure here stands
out almost as if it were done in sculpture.</p>

<a name="PORTRAIT_OF_TITIAN" id="PORTRAIT_OF_TITIAN"></a>
PORTRAIT OF TITIAN</p>

<p>Probably no other painter in the world&rsquo;s history
was ever granted so long a life in which to develop
his art as was Titian. He was a mere boy when he
began to paint, and he was still busy with his brush
when stricken with plague at the age of ninety-nine.</p>

<p>The years between were full of activity, and every
decade was marked by some specially notable work
as by a golden milestone. The Assumption of the
Virgin was painted at the age of forty, the Pesaro
Madonna at fifty, the Presentation of the Virgin in
his early sixties, the portrait of Philip II. at about
seventy, and St. John the Baptist at eighty. How
interesting it would be if we could have a portrait
of the man himself painted at each decade!</p>

<p>Titian, however, seems to have been quite lacking
in personal vanity. Though a handsome and distinguished-looking
man, a fine subject for a portrait,
he seldom painted his own likeness. We value the
more the fine portrait of our frontispiece painted at
the age of eighty-five. The years have dealt so
gently with him that we may still call him a handsome
man. Yet the face has the shrunken look of
old age, there are deep hollows about the eyes, and
the features are sharpened under the withered skin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
There is an expression which seems almost like awe
in the eyes. The painter gazes absently into space
as if piercing beyond the veil which separates this
world from the next. The mood does not seem to
be one of reminiscence, but rather of grave anticipation.</p>

<p>As we study the face we are interested to read in
it what we know of the man&rsquo;s character and history.
Titian was, as we have seen, a man who enjoyed very
much the good things of life, and passed most of his
days in luxurious surroundings. He was thoroughly
a man of the world, at ease in the society of princes
and noblemen, and a princely host in his own house.
Our portrait shows that his courtly bearing did not
fail him in his old age: we can fancy the ceremonious
courtesy of his manner. The figure is extended
well below the waist, perhaps that we may see how
erect the old man is.</p>

<p>Titian, too, had not a little taste for literature
and the society of the learned. His fine high brow
and keen eyes are sufficient evidence that he was a
man of intellect. That he was a fond father we have
no doubt, and we like to trace the lines of kindliness
in the fine old face.</p>

<p>Age cannot quench the old man&rsquo;s ardor for his art.
The brush is still his familiar companion, and will go
with him to the end. He holds it here in his right
hand, in the attitude of a painter pausing to get
the effect of his work. It may be from this that he
would have us think that his glance is directed toward
his canvas. In that case, the serious expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
would indicate that the subject is a solemn one,
perhaps the Ecce Homo, or the Pieta, which he
painted in his later years.</p>

<p>We see that his hand had not lost its cunning
in summoning before us the real presence of a sitter,
and that he could paint his own likeness as readily
as that of another. The portrait shows us the best
elements in a man of a many-sided nature. This is
Titian the master, whom the world honors as one of
the greatest of his kind.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
